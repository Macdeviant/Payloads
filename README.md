# Payloads
PHP tool for creating Configuration Profile .mobileconfig files with custom payloads that install correctly. (See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/170520/os-x-profile-manager-mail-settings-smtp-password-not-being-pushed-for-os-x-dev)
Helpful for creating one off Profiles or creating custom preconfigured client-facing pages that allow for easy access downloads of tailor-made profiles.
Currently only supports single Mail account payloads to workaround broken Apple implementation.
